# Scraping-Cardekho

## Getting Started
Some websites automatically block any kind of scraping have defined a header to pass along the get command to make our queries look like they are coming from an actual browser. Also I have used the sleep command while I run the program between pages, it will help the process to seem like it is a more natural behavior.

## Saving our data
Organized the arrays in a single DataFrame so I can save it as a csv or excel file and access the information later without having to repeat the process above.
I have defined the names for the columns, and merge the arrays in a single DataFrame.
